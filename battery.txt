* Battery Saving Mode

To reduce your battery consumption you can:

- Switch your phone to 2G:
Settings -> Phone -> Network …then select GSM.

3G or UMTS is required for video calls, VoIP calls and high speed internet browsing.

- Ensure your Bluetooth is turned off:
Settings -> Connection -> Bluetooth

You can also try turning off WiFi when not in use, lowering your screen’s brightness, not using animated wallpapers.

Contact your local Smart Wireless Center for more information or help on changing the settings of your phone.
